# RBAC_IN_DATA_LAKES
This repository consists of our practical eexperiments for accessing files stored in an S3 data-bucket.

## How to run
To run the code AWS credentials are required. Ask Rasmus Herskind (rher) or Karl Kvaran (kkva) for the credentials.

Each experiment is designed to be able to run independent of each other.
